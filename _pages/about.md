I am a high school junior from India and a programmer, web-developer and Machine Learning Enthusiast. Iâ€™m particularly excited about probabilistic machine learning and deep neural networks.

This blog however is mostly a Computer Science Research blog for my weekend experiments with ML/DL in general.
Feel free to go through it and hit me up if you find something that excites you too!
